# image-processing-stuff - A simple demonstration of pipelined, deferred-execution image processing.

## What is pipelined, deferred-execution image processing (PDIP)?
Pipelined, deferred-execution image processing is an architectural pattern for doing, even very complex, image processing in a simple and efficient, and cloud-friendly way.  It's not a new pattern.  It's been around for decades.  Despite it's usefulness, I believe that it's under-utilized in industry and academia.  Recent technology advancements (in particular, "the cloud") has made this nice, old architectural pattern very relevant again, IMO.  This little code repository attempts to highlight the usefulness of PDIP by using it to do something that is both complex enough to be non-trivial and somewhat useful in the real-world - orthorectify images from low-flying aircraft (like a drone).
